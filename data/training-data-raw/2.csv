Did you guys know that it all started when the Rothschild bought the Israel land. Yes it’s about money and they want to make a new canal route through Gaza
"Thats what happens when u vote hamas to take over your country. Where is the president? He flew away. Left his citizen. 😂 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freepalestinefromhamas"">#freepalestinefromhamas</a>"
Hamas: one of the worst governments ever. They brought this on their people.
Good morning motherfuckers.
Islam = Terroristen
"Also it has the ancient silk Road, an the largest gas reserves in their water, worth billions/trillion.. many leaders already signed the agreement…."
"Ask your hamaas  to stop attacking  Isreal,  first they only started  war."
"If we consider the two hundred and fourteenth verse of Surah Al-Baqarah, the words of God Almighty: {Or did you think that you would enter Paradise when there came to you the likeness of those who passed away before you, afflicted by calamity and affliction? And they were shaken until the Messenger and those who believed with him said, “When will God give you victory?” Indeed, God’s help is near. This verse was revealed on the Day of the Parties, when the polytheists were besieging the Muslims, and they came to them from the top of the city, and the Jews were at the bottom of it, and the hypocrites were in the ranks, discouraging the people and making them suspicious; Some Muslims even had some doubt inside them, and said: O Messenger of God! We are armed in the morning and evening, meaning: We are always afraid, expecting the enemy to come to us from here or here, so God Almighty revealed this verse to show them that among the laws of God before victory is scrutiny, trial, and earthquake. Or did you think, O Muslims, that you would enter Paradise when you did not know the news of the predecessors among the followers of the Prophets who were touched by calamities and hardships?War, fighting, and adversity: harm such as illness, poverty, and the like. They were shaken by fear, to the point that the Prophet among them was asking himself and the believers with him and saying: When will God give victory? God Almighty said: {Indeed, God’s victory is near}. And in this battle came the opportunity that exposed the hypocrites at a time of weakness of the Muslims, and at the time of the arrival of the enemies of the Muslims. The hypocrites fear the strength of the Muslims. If the Muslims are strong, then hypocrisy does not appear in them, and if they are weak, then their denial appears. The Battle of Al-Ahzab took place in the month of Shawwal in the fifth year of the Hijra (corresponding to March 627 AD). The Conquest of Mecca (also called the Great Conquest) was a conquest that took place on the twentieth of Ramadan in the eighth year of the Hijra (corresponding to January 10, 630 AD). God willing, the conquest of Jerusalem will be in the year 2026 AD. Oh God, make these words of ours a sign of the Battle of the Parties... Amen."
So horrific. And US tax dollars make this slaughter possible.
"After a while, one stops feeling sympathy for Palestine. Why did Hamas kidnap civilians in the first place ? Why are refusing to return the hostages ? Why is Hamas allowing Gaza to get levelled ? Where were the global protests against ISIS and Al Qaeda ?"
The end of Netanyahu is near and the return of Palestine is near
"A Zionist in 1948 occupied the land of Palestine... 🇵🇸The land will soon return to its people, all of Palestine"
"Why they don’t mention how Israel in the crossfire with hamas kill and Bomb they own citizens in October 7, why they don’t show the proof of the 40 babies that supposedly got be headed, I see how Palestinian parents put their kids remains in bags after the explosion, why if they so though instead of bombing innocent civilians, why they don’t go in with their soldiers and look for the tunnels and rescued the hostages, they always talk about how we got intelligence that hammas is Hiding under building, how come they didn’t have intelligence on October 7, all this was planned to get USA and our soldiers to fight their war in Iran for them"
Manny of CNN anchor are just racist pigs who want to present Israel terrorist act as “they just defending themselves “ the word is watching
Reduced to ashes? What was reduced to ashes in Israel on Oct 7? People!
😬
Why Hamas didn’t built shelters for the people?because they want misery to manipulate the world .
Where&#39;s your gay Allah now 😂🎉😂😂🎉

"- Britain&#39;s Most Famous Philosopher on Zionism -<br>The article discusses the final letter written by the British philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1970. It highlights the following key points:<br><br>Bertrand Russell&#39;s Background: The article introduces Bertrand Russell as a prominent British philosopher, mathematician, logician, and public intellectual who made significant contributions to various fields, including mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and more. He was a Nobel Prize winner for literature and known for championing humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.<br><br>Russell&#39;s Pacifism and Activism: Russell&#39;s background as a pacifist and anti-imperialist is mentioned, along with his imprisonment during World War I for his pacifist beliefs. He also criticized Stalin and the United States&#39; involvement in the Vietnam War. Russell became an advocate for nuclear disarmament.<br><br>Russell&#39;s Critique of Israel&#39;s Actions: In January 1970, Russell issued a letter condemning Israel&#39;s actions in the Middle East, particularly Israeli bombing raids deep into Egyptian territory. He likened these actions to the bombing raids carried out by Nazi Germany during the Battle of Britain and the United States&#39; bombing of Vietnam.<br><br>Calls for Israeli Withdrawal: Russell called for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders and expressed his concern over Israel&#39;s expansion by force. He believed that every new conquest became a basis for negotiation from a position of strength, which ignored the injustice of previous aggression.<br><br>The Plight of Palestinian Refugees: Russell emphasized the plight of Palestinian refugees who were made homeless by the creation of a new state. He asserted that refugees have the right to return to their homeland, and denying this right is at the heart of the ongoing conflict.<br><br>Comparisons to Holocaust Suffering: The article mentions that some people justified sympathizing with Israel by referencing the suffering of Jews in Europe during the Holocaust. Russell rejected this as a reason to perpetuate any suffering and accused it of being gross hypocrisy.<br><br>The Need for a Just Settlement: Russell concluded that to end the bloodshed in the Middle East, a just settlement is needed. He called for Israeli withdrawal from all territories occupied in June 1967 as the first step toward achieving a lasting settlement.<br><br>Relevance and Contemporary Significance: The article highlights that Russell&#39;s letter, written over 50 years ago, remains relevant and contemporary in addressing the ongoing issues and injustices in the Middle East. The article suggests that if Russell were alive today, he would still be concerned and horrified by the situation in the occupied territories and Gaza.<br><br>Recommendation to Read &quot;The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine&quot;: The article recommends the book &quot;The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine&quot; by Israeli historian Ilan Pappé, which provides meticulous historical details and archival evidence regarding the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.<br><br>These are the main points delivered in the article about Bertrand Russell&#39;s final letter and his perspective on the Middle East conflict."
CNN IS THE MEDIA PIMP OF ZIONIST ENTITY
"Warga Gaza jika tidak lari ngungsi , Tewas salah sendiri."
It&#39;s sad to see what Hamas&#39; terrorism has caused for Israel and also tgeir own prople.
Where Is Humanity The Women And Kids And Olds Dies After Israeli Attack
Where Is Humanity The Women And Kids And Olds Dies After Israeli Attack
Where Is Humanity ?
Would God regret giving Israel this land if he knew they were doing this?

"“Israel” was founded in 1948 on the mythical claim that “God” promised them this land in the Old Testament back around 1200BC, that’s about 3.3 k years back!!!!!! You wake up after 3000 years to remember that your God promised you some land where you have to go and wipe out its indiginous people and bring in your own people who your God prefers😆😆😆🥲. How fucked up is this argument!!!!! <br><br>The Zionists invented (because genuine [ie good] Jews don’t accept this myth, in fact they fight it whenever possible) this myth for the following reasons: <br><br>(1) convince the Jews around the world to migrate to their home land (that their God promised them which they call “Israel” or Palestine to Arabs), (2) justify the taking over of Palestine <br><br>The real reason why the Zionists worked hard on establishing home for Jews in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the rising antisemetism around the world and especiaaly in Europe.  The Hitler’s gas champers against Jews (which was a horrible thing no doubt) in WW2 helped them garner more support to establish their home especially from Britain and the US, hence their “Independence War” in 1948 where they defeated the Palestinians and Arabs to take over half of Palestine. Then they launched another surprise attack in 1967 to take over the other half (the West Bank and Gaza). <br><br>So, “Israel” is an OCCUPATION. Just because you’re hated and persecuted around the world, doesnt give you the right to occupy another country and make its people suffer 1000 times you did. <br><br>If you have doubts about this narration, just Google “Belfour Declaration”, or “Zionism”."
"Everything you see- hamas is to blame. And he is gonna pay the price for killing innocent civilians- men, women, children, babies..<br>I&#39;m not jealous in Hamas terrorists once they face idf soldiers, special forces who eager to eliminate the barbaric  nazis-isis-hamas regime<br><br>For all the people that call yo free palestine- did you condemn hamas atrocities first? You prefer to support dark cruel regime over Israel which is a beacon to the free world"
How can regular American citizens help?
"Where there is complete destruction like Syria, Afghanistan, Gaza there are Muslims, its bitter but true, then they say, terrorism has no religion. Enough is Enough."
These videos depict war crime. What a nightmare.😢
CNN is a propaganda machine complicit in war crimes and massacre of innocent people. CNN has no integrity or humanity.
"There is absolutely reason to suspect that Israel just like Deng Xiaoping assign Hamas to launch suicide attack is looking for excuses to invade and occupy Gaza, and require International Military Court to conduct thorough investigation as soon as possible"
Is that not how all wars are? Unfortunately Hamas runs Palestine.
"Imagine that you live peacefully in your own homeland, and then some invaders come to kill you and take your own homes and your own lives saying that this is their own homeland.

Shocking....absolutely shocking. Isreal is practicing state terrorism even better than the Nazis did! Shameful.
Gaza sorry to say this but your government farked you all over. The worst way at that
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🙏🙏
The Israeli Electronic Army occupies the comments on this channel... Can&#39;t you say a single word that is not a lie?
"After the terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, two hundred Israeli citizens were taken hostage, including children. Many Arab countries are protesting against Israel demanding that the attacks on Gaza stop. Innocent people are being killed and are demanding the release of the hostages.  There were no demonstrations anywhere demanding the release of innocent hostages, nor was any Arab country coming forward to unconditionally release the innocent hostages. What is the fault of the innocent people killed?"
who start the war pelistine hamas or isreal?
"Why is no one, the media not showing the damage done to Israel? The only thing I see is cars destroyed a few buildings but no real structural damage."
We are with Palestine.
I urge the Arab League to sanction the US and Israel.<br><br>￼
Why the west doesn&#39;t care about them! What&#39;s making them so blind?  Thousand of dead children&#39;s image floating in my mind. It breaks my heart just to think about this. Does the world really don&#39;t care about them? They hate Muslims this much?
"Israel is BOMBING Gaza, kill Civillian.... They destroyed building, HOSPITAL with 500 people die.... <br><br>But if we compare with so many sanction for Russia who never kill Civillian and BOMBED THE HOSPITAL, I think the west won&#39;t give Israel a Sanction.... <br><br>Let me guess why..... <br><br>It must be &quot; Double Standard &quot;....... <br><br>AWESOME...... 👏👏👏👏👏"
We May speak in different languages  but we are all  human beings human cannot harm others we were created form a drop of soil and a drop of water
I had sympathy for the Jews and the holocaust. Now that I see how they treat the Palestinians that sympathy has evaporated. Imagine that. They disgust me as much as the nazis did. They have declared war on the entire Palestinian population for the actions of a few. Do they forget when war was declared on their entire Jewish population and what that was like?
Free Palestine
"Stop your BS hamas IS NOT Palestine!! so far Israel is only killing palestinians, if the US has a terrorism issue is it gonna start bombing everything in Mexico ? ofc not"
CNN blames America for the Pearl Harbor attack. Hamas bombs their own hospital!
"SEA, WATER, TUNNEL hamas"
Keep counting. It will take a lot more than 5 years.
Ura not even a country anymore
Its as though these western gets orgasms seeing how much destruction and death the West causes. They report as though they are pleased to see Palestinians dead and their homes and cities destroyed. It&#39;s as though these western media just enjoy seeing israel kill innocent women and children so they can report sounding like this. You can swear the reporter is smirking in pure pleasure just seeing the destruction and death and blood and crying people. He seems to enjoy watching people suffer
We can make any assumptions we want.. but as an American.. I have to say America and Israel are the real terrorists correct me if im wrong.
Israel should not be allowed to be above the law. This is a crime. This is genocide.

🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱✌️✌️✌️💪💪🇺🇸
"Next is  to Annexe the land and  give it to  the colon after build a new wall, then 05 years later it will be fully Israel territory."
THESE ARE SEEDS SOWN BY HAMAS.<br>A TERROR TERRORIST GROUP OF GAZA......
Now everyone know: hammas is isses
Hamas now is Ham in Ass.
War crime on video
National Geographic 1946. Israel is not a real country!
False flag to bring US into war for second israel.
"Gaza civilians should have known not to live in Gaza, stop complaining about damages when you put yourselves under the control of terrosists. Yes it is unfortunate, but you should have left gaza after Hamas beheaded innocent israeli children. These things have CONSEQUENCES."
"I am ashamed of my country, the USA for the uncritical support of Israel. We are being told Israel is morally superior to Hamas but it&#39;s not true. Hamas just gave Israel a small dose of what Israel did to the Palestinians in 1947-48 when the Zionists staged massacres and atrocities to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians from their homes. The Zionist plan to do this was in place even before the Holocaust. Starting in the 1920s, Israel sent spies to every Palestinian town and village to gather information about how each could best be attacked. When the order was finally given in 1947, the Israeli troops went into each village/town. They herded everyone into the town square, then lined up all of the leaders of the Arab community and shot them in the head. The people were then told to leave and never return. Anyone who resisted was killed. Some 700,000+ Palestinians were driven from their homes in this way. Massacres were also staged to scare the people into leaving. Many of the Palestinians who fled ended up in refugee camps in Gaza set up by the UN. The Gaza residents of today are the descendants of those refugees. They lost everything, family members, homes, property, and their future. This is the ugly reality that Americans fail to understand because the Zionist owned media repeats endless lies. Sadly, most Americans believe whatever they are told. Wake up people. The neocons (Jewish warmongers like Victoria Nuland and Anthony Blinken at the US state department) already had us on the brink of Nuclear War with Russia over Ukraine. Now -- because of Israel&#39;s racist Apartheid system -- we face another crisis that can just as easily escalate to WW III --- in an afternoon. Americans, please realize we are in danger of losing our country. Zionists rule America. They own Congress, Wall Street, most of the US war machine, the media and Hollywood. If the American people do not wake up soon, our 200+ year experiment in democratic government is over."
Imagine CNN defending Hamas by promoting damages done to Gaza - a terrosist run territory - yet they refuse to acknowledge what hamas did was wrong
"Out of proportion. Unnecessary destruction and carnage. Outright violation of human right. No regard for human lives. This bombing has nothing to do with removing Hamas. It&#39;s genocide. I deplore this senseless, murderous atrocity. Israel will pay the price."
"they Arabs of Gaza slaughtered, raped, burned kids alive! Chopped babies heads! They chopped organs, we found a woman that her baby was taken out of her stomach!!!! As they are dead found together the baby still connected to her stomach.<br>We will never forget and never forgive.<br>Only death with torture to All Arabs of Gaza, all of them are Nazi"
OPEC country raise  oil  price for Europe  and America.  it&#39;s  best opportunity
"There is no war, the USA + CNN invented a war for the $$$$$$$$$$. Israel and its land, air and water army against terrorists on scooters and hidden behind ruins. There is no army against Israel, nothing, zero. Lots of terrorists like cockroaches and nothing else but lots of $$$$$$$$$$$$.... Iraq &amp; Afghanistan all over again."
"A lot of this is propaganda blaming one side over the other… put all that aside and you’ll see Palestine and Israel have have been fighting for a long long time… israel has been fighting all of its neighbors for quite awhile. Hamas has killed many innocents, babies too… just as Israel has… this will never end unless one side completely irradiated the other… both hate each other. Neither want peace… Hamas declared back when they came to power that they won’t stop until all Jews are destroyed."
"The Israelis are being led into a trap. Hezbollah and Iran are waiting for their soldiers to enter fax’s leaving the nation underdefended. They will use the same tactics as Ukraine is using against Russia and kill many Israeli soldiers. The whole thing was planned to incur maximum anger and a huge response to lead to the next trap….a massive attack on Israel. They don’t care about their own people , just how many Israelis they can kill."
When isreyel people were sleeping Hamas started the war but Why killing innocent people at Isreyel.. They were also sleeping then why .. so now ball is with Isreyel.. haha now please don’t cry .. you the whole world living with a great dream to make whole world  filled with this wretched Muslim community.. The so called God is everywr .. letz wait n see 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
🇸🇩🌹🌹❤️
He never fired a rocket but he helped build them.
"Moral of the story: do not go to war with 10,000 soldiers against a king who has 100,000."
CNN glorify of the zionist bombing inncent women and kids. The question is ICC is not going to issue no warrent arrest against Natanyahu for war crime killing innocent women and children?  So ICC is going nute? The world has no other choices but to arming themselves with nuclear weapons. That is the only choice they have.
The Khazarians commit crimes in the Middle East in the name of Hebrew.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🇵🇸
"Why CNN, funded by terrorist organisation, don&#39;t show the devastation by CNN favourite Hamas."
Lanat ho tm or b or yahodio pr b
These mooslims speak of martyrdom but when martyrdom knocks on their door they slip through the back door
YouTube making money time to buy oil stocks..
The fact that HAMAS was not prepped with water and food for their people proves that their attack was a quick order by Iran.<br>It is ridiculous that US and Israel are making Iran to be innocent and did not intervene in this war.
So sad they have to suffer the consequences when they didn’t do anything wrong.Good people always suffer
"The real terrorist is the one who stole the land of Palestine and fought its people. The terrorist is the one who besieges Gaza and kills its children and women in front of the whole world. What is this world, the majority of which has become a bunch of hypocrites?<br> The real terrorist is Israel"
"Why does CNN and other networks always portray GAZA as the innocent ones, when Gaza has killed innocent Israeli people also?"
Free Palatine man 🇵🇸🇵🇸
Save Palestine 🇵🇸 <br>Israel are killing everyone
The Zionists occupied Palestine 75 years ago and expelled its people. They are resisting to liberate their homeland. This is the truth that the media hides.
