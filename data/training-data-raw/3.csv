"Israel has free health care and free education that we don&#39;t have in the US yet every single year billions of our tax dollars are given to Israel for free.   If they can afford free health care, why can&#39;t they afford to pay for their own war crimes?"
"&quot;... when you come back from the Third World to the West - the U.S. in particular - you are struck by the narrowing of thought and understanding, the limited nature of legitimate discussion, the separation of people from each other. It&#39;s startling how stultifying it feels, since our opportunities are so vastly greater here.&quot;<br><br>-Noam Chomsky"
"&quot;The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there&#39;s free thinking going on, while all the time the <br>presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.&quot;<br><br>-Noam Chomsky"
OOPS! Legacy Zionist propagandists did it again. They called a GENOCIDE a war.
Palestine is just beginning to understand that retribution IS REAL.
Retribution IS REAL.
Palestinian or Hamas = same same! One is no different than the other!!!! near 75% of Palestinians support Hamas and in reality Gaza is nothing more than a giant size Madrassa
Nothing by land grab by Netanyahu. He wants to go down in history books as a leader who expanded his country.
I wonder why Egypt won’t let them in? Could it be because Egypt doesn’t want to deal with the terrorists? 🤔
THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS NOW!!!!!
Who cares? Come visit California
You seem so humane. But this is journalistic hogwash. These innocent people voted for hamas and celebrate terror. They&#39;re not innocent. They&#39;ve gladly been human shields. You would not trust them with any of your own possessions so stop the hogwash
"Is very sadly seen to PALESTINE PEOPLE  HOW SUFFERING ,LONGER  LIFE AND BLESSING.  ALL OUR PRAYER TO PALESTINE, CESARFIRE"
Muslims FAFO…again
Arab countries open your borders for follow Arabs ?
Israel is a terrorist state.
america is a Christian country so how can Biden allow something like this to happen? its morally wrong
"What about the 200,000 ISRAELI CIVILLIANS DISPLACED FROM THE southern and northern border regions living in Tents in freezing Jerusalem?<br>The Pals were complicit in their own circumstance, the Israelis  were not. They supported Hamas and danced in the streets Oct 8th, no one wants to hear any whining now."
Shameful
"After all these years and the world watching the 🇺🇸 USA build, organize and strive to bring their citizens the best, YOU WOUKD THINK THE WOLD WORLD WOULD HAVE LEARNED TO DO YHE SAME FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRIES AND DI THE SAME FOR THEIR CITIZENS.  PEOPLE STOP BEING STINGY.  You have to spend money for your country and keep your citizens healthy to keep the country alive and wealthy.  You are killing your future by, being so cheap, stingy, that is not even referred to as being frugal!  Stingy means you don’t have expensive taste!  You like trash, you receive and accept garbage 🗑️ and trash, unlike USA 🇺🇸 and Dubai UAE 🇦🇪 Japan 🇯🇵 WHERE THERE ARE NO THIEVES, you can leave your 📱 phone, laptop, 💻 wallet, 💳 card anything in public and return to find it in the same spot where you left it.  When will you lazy, greedy ones learn to imitate good habits?"
❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈❤️❤️❤️✝️🙏🏽
I really don’t get it. These people would rather live like this than to turn over the terrorists !! This is what happens when you force other countries to take care of your trash. If you’re not going to do it yourself then stay in the tents until somebody else gets the job done👿
الہ تعلا حماس مھجرین کی مدد فرماے اور انکو بھی عقل دے جو اپن زات اورطاقتیدار کی جنگ لڑ رھے ھین
It’s either your homeless or camping. Do they have electric and water hookups. Campings expensive
"The US and UK are part of the agenda. They aren&#39;t calling for a ceasefire because they have collaborated with Israel to gain something in return for the destruction and genocide of Gaza, possibly natural resources, wealth etc"
So did the water that ran from that gutter use to be clean?
That looks like Haiti  after the Clintons washed all of our charity money.
O little town of Bethlehem<br>How still we see thee lie<br>Above thy deep and dreamless sleep<br>The silent stars go by<br>Yet in thy dark streets shineth<br>The everlasting light<br>The hopes and fears of all the years<br>Are met in thee tonight. <br><br>Merry Christmas!
Now that is a proper refugee camp.
Why won&#39;t their brothers in Islam take them?  Quite telling.
"Preserve me, O God, I say to the Lord, &quot; Thou art my Lord; I have no good apart from Thee.&quot; The Lord is my chosen. I keep the Lord always before me. No matter what man does."
Why doesn&#39;t Egypt welcome them in? Or Qatar? Or Saudi Arabia? Or Iran?
Can&#39;t wait for the liberal left to bring all these people here.  Maybe they can dump them in Chicago and New York.
What will be the impact of flooding Gaza’s tunnels with seawater?<br><br>Pumping seawater into tunnel networks will damage water supplies and agriculture - and could breach international
Mess with Israel God&#39;s chosen people and Yaweh message to the enemies of Yaweh and this is reality what happens
Interesting how the surrounding countries have borders
In the future stop hiding losers under schools and such😮😊
The media brutally participates in the killing of Gaza&#39;s children
While some men sit comfortably on their seats and veto ceasefire
"if you have live satellite access you can see that the latest wars have created a return of the sea peoples from makoko to china kids are orphaned in these boats arounf puberty and they know no land as home. yes they are self sufficeint fishermsm boys and girls and yiu know what? per capita since judge gregg abbott of texas and politician ron desantis of Florida sent all those immigrants to Martha&#39;s vinyard and GavinNewsom housed 3 million people off the streets in LosAngees , the percent of homeless residents are about equal 😊 to each other.<br>world peace 1989<br>worldwar3 2023 😢 if my 18 year old self knew , id be trembling in tears"
Israel is acting evil they should follow their own religious teachings about a Jewish state
nbc supports terrorism...shame on you
"The Palestinians kids and general the Palestinians they have nothing to do with all these ,thousands of kids got killed and manny thousands of innocent people for the wrong reason to benefit others,where is the humanitarian help ,everyone is closing their eyes,it is horrible this is sick,the make believe civilisation nations looking the other way ,stop everything right now from both ways ,it is horrible."
"Others laugh and others cry, unacceptable what you become in the interests of some, which the human rights organization ;everyone closes eyes only words are, Europe has been through such situations and had to react differently but the invisible claw keeps everyone unsteady and obedient to injustice and mischief."
"People, they invaded Israel for the 100th time, massacred 1500 civilians and you feel sorry for them. You are either to young or too stupid to know that the palestinians have been committing similar atrocities for over 50 years! read your history. The problem needs to be solved once and for all. Jordan occupies 80% of the land that these Arabs could be living in, why no outrage over that?"
You all Muslim has no respect for God
Power to Palestine!✊️🇵🇸
Most of these displaced palestinians still love hamas terrorists and they still hate Israel and want to destroy Israel. So let them have it
American president is the killer of humanity
"Shame on our world human rights leaders,UN"
"Thats why stop attacking Israel, and stop endlessly making children in poor condition"
"It is clear that Israeli policy cannot be never-ending occupation, violence, ethnic cleansing and dispossession of Palestinian land until there is no man, woman and child left?  A 2-State solution is the only path to Peace! Live and let live, with an UN-Monitoring presence for the first few years until both sides learn to live with each other side by side."
"Palestine really should have declared independence 75 years ago, instead of starting to attack and try to wipe Israel off the map (from the river to the sea) Palestinians kept trying and they kept failing. Actions have consequences."
It&#39;s  time to ban you tube now.
"what a warmongering, savage, baby-killing and terrorizing Israeli government... they&#39;re worst than Hamas... 18,000 deaths????? 1/3 of the casualties are babies. I&#39;m ashamed to have thought good things about Israel... shame on me"
Thanks for showing this.   Very sad to see
God bless the children of Israel and Palestine.
"Shame on Biden for supporting such a horrific catastrophe. This war was never about hamas. It&#39;s about ethnic cleansing. Next, they push whoever survives into Egypt. Israel has already started planning settlements in Gaza, the right wing government under Netanyahu is more of a terrorist than hamas."
Thought that was London for a sec
GO EGIPTO STORMS IS COMING ALERT STORM IS COMING GOD SAID GET OUT
I know homeless people in the U.S. who live in tents all year round. They should’ve never let Hamas take over.
"That&#39;s not right and crimes against humanity, that is not defending Israel it&#39;s the persecution of innocent people and the world just stands by watching, that is very cruel"
Don&#39;t call INNOCENT GAZANS they are HAMAS symphaisers
Hamas brought this onto their own people.
Hamas harus bertanggung jawab terhadap rakyatnya
Why if thers killed you are going to say palestnians but when you start the war you crying oug loux you let hamas your own grave
"Since the humanitarian, liberal, enlightened USA thinks this is okay, what would you think of 2 million zionists in tent cities?  Bad memories huh?"
Ask Egypt why they not accept palestonians
As usual Hala is afraid to walk around on the ground.  Remember her getting the heck out of Egypt after one day!!!
It looks like California 🤷‍♀️
They should really vote better next time...
I noticed you didn&#39;t ask how any of these people felt about Hamas and whether or not they understand that this could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders and releases the hostages from October 7th.

Egypt must open border to gazans <br>Egypt is responsible for death of gazan<br>ENGLAND  MUST ACCEPT PALESTINIAN <br>NOT SEND THEM TO RAWANDA<br>BRITISH PEOPLE HATE ARABS<br>THATS WHY PRONCESS DIANE AND EGYPTIPN<br>ARAB BOYFRIEND
"Egypt should be a passage way for food, water, medication."
This would be intolerable if caused by a natural disaster. The facts that humans are causing this and that my nation funds it are beyond my comprehension.
"Yet hamas&#39; leaders are billionaires. When a nation has wicked corrupted government and leaders, the people will surely suffer. <br><br>Ismail Haniyeh has been calling the Palestinians women, children and elderly to shed their blood.  So why are the Palestinians crying when their leader Ismail keeps asking them to shed their blood."
"Hamas was created on the basis of an ideology that does not recognize Israel&#39;s right to exist and all Hamas actions are aimed at the destruction of Israel and the creation of an Islamic Palestinian state on Israeli territory. And most Arab countries, including Palestine, support Hamas.<br>And what should Israel do after another Hamas terrorist attack, atrocities against civilians and hostage-taking? What actions will the UN take against Hamas?"
Bs
Governi USA Europa e Israele assassini. <br>Israele perderà.
Amazing how fast Palestinians got a tent city up. They might choose Bedouin life in the desert herding goats and sheep. I would if it was me.
I read in 2013 the Egyptians used sewage water to flood the tunnels. Israel is using sea water now.
"If you put your place in The position of people of Gaza you can see that humanity must take primary position over all else  and call for a  humanitarian aid and ceasefire of hostilities both sides of conflict .<br>Would Allah praise be his name take delight in this ?<br>WouldYHVH and (    )  take delight in this <br>Elohim, El Shaddai ,<br>Would the good Djinn ?<br>Would the Moshiach ?<br><br>Here is what Jesus said <br>“Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of God”<br><br>It is good message , good advice , good way to perceive life <br>Why ?<br>Because only God is good <br>It should be considered ."
"I don&#39;t think Israel realises the level of humanitarian crisis they have created, or perhaps more worryingly, they just don&#39;t care =("
Its only Allah Who knows the last breathe
Watching this makes me feel so sad.  How can my government veto a ceasefire is beyond my comprehension.
Then one day for no reason at all.
"Running out of words!!!<br>The situation in Gaza is very difficult to see. Can we or should we overlook these events? Should we stand by in silence as this is going on?<br>In today&#39;s society, we are all interconnected and cannot ignore what is going on in Gaza.<br>A cease fire is urgently needed and is being requested across the globe.<br>~~<br>Israel is in breach of International Human Law."
They were not complaining on October 7
America and Israel have so much to answer for. The truth can never be hidden. The people of the world are witness to their gruesome atrocities.
"Jewish land since 1500 BCE, then occupied by ROME, and the Eastern Roman Empire. Then INVADERS CALLED ARAB MUSLIMS. THERE NOT INDIGENOUS BUT COLONIZERS OF JEWISH LAND!!! GOOD RIDDANCE 😂"
I have never seen something like this. This is so sad
If Egypt is a muslim country and supports Palestin then why they don&#39;t let palestinians to enter their country?
"Well, this is what happens when you elect a Terrorist Group as your Govt. Meanwhile, the billionaire Leaders of HAMAS  are living it up , in Qatar. How you like that? They got billions in Qatar, you starving and cold in a tent. Thats what they think of you, and how concerned they are about you. How much of their personal billions in wealth have they spent on medicine, food, water for the Gazans? You need to start asking yourselves that question."
"They are going thirsty, hungry, and they lack shelter.  Winter is coming.  So many people have already died.  So many more will die.  This is so cruel."
"To achieve lasting piece, Israel must occupy Gaza for next 20 years of a generation, to re-educate Paletinians&#39; children. This is how Catherine The Great transformed Russians."
This has been happening since October. Where has the rest of the world been?
"I’m a pathetic about humanity, I believe that after Israel helping rebuild Gaza, they will attack Israel again and be pitiful, “I can’t find medicine, I don’t have shelter, I can’t find food and water, why don’t they give us peace” all over again."
So the palestine 🇵🇸 story only gets 2 minutes of coverage. Horse shot.
💪🇮🇱♥️
