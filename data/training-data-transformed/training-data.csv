what can i say i got too silly,2
the zionazi state of israel has been accused of using chemical weapons on the palestinian people as seen on videos not only this time but many times before during conflicts and it seems they have the impunity from using it there is hardly any serious talks on this matter,1
an independent palestinian state and the right of return of all palestinians in forced exile is the only solution and only the usa can make it happen the world is watching this unequal treatment by the so-called leader of democracy,1
war crimes supported by usa i,1
this is a holocaust genocide a murdering land grab,1
the hamas announced yesterday idf is lying about its casualties its lot more than say and why are they celebrating the surrounding of gaza we are not a big country rather a small area lol idf is a joke,1
jews always causing problems,1
it looks like an apocalypse my prayers for those affected,1

if arabs really cared for palestinians they would imiedetly accept war refugees like poland open up for ukrainians in need despite difference in religion . how come any of their neighbors wants them save the women and children if they care so much,0
united states needs to get rid of islamic radicals and deport them their hate of the jewish community which is only % of the us population and hatred is not wanted especially death threats i hear nothing about this and such a weak government,0
zechariah :-(tlb)- this is the fate of israeli as pronounced by the lord who stretched out the heavens laid the foundation of the earth and formed the spirit of man within him i will make jerusalem and judah like a cup of poison to all the nearby nations that send their armies to surround jerusalem jerusalem will be a heavy stone burdening the world and though all the nations of the earth unite in an attempt to move her they will all be crushed,2
i&#;m old enough now to not care what any of these generals say when instantly it&#;s clear israel has chosen to enter their vietnam and they will suffer precisely the same consequences and more it&#;s tragic it was foolish to enter and the genocide and brutality is unacceptable israel could have waited to unify the world for the cause of gaza and israel to find unity during the sympathy that was very brief after oct . instead they rushed in and you do know what they say about people who rush in entry was ilconcieved and the miles of tunnels are about as viet cong as it gets it&#;s full metal jacket and it will only end with tragedy and more hostility for every day they stay in there it&#;s literally like nobody had time to watch the history channel in israel for a hard education on modern warfare the weapons are much more extreme on both sides it&#;s not just the history repeats itself the end games are just pause points,0
"let me share some facts on the issue in gaze since you are unable to and do not have the courage to share such facts as of november , , over , civilians were killed of the civilians killed , are children and , are women nba , how many more palestinian babies have to die before you provide a fair and unbiased coverage",1
only liberals will give our war plans on air but refuse to even admit the corruption of joe widen and his crackhead son this is why america can&#;t win wars they don&#;t want america to win,2
not only are the jews false in their declarations commitments and oaths but they are also false in the bloody events that we are witnessing at the moment it is extremely suspicious why the jewish military services did not lift a finger and let the conflict break out leaving fellow countrymen at a loss israeli intelligence community is too clever has a substantial cia backup and is very infiltrated in all palestinian organizations including hamas they don&#;t make mistakes it&#;s israel&#;s thirst for killing palestinians and occupying land,1
that is white phosphorus which is a war crime but does criminals care about the law,1

a principle that the life of an innocent human being has no value and that such a life can be summarily discounted by a person exercising a right to self defence is israel itself committing heinous war crimes the world should never allow israel to uphold such an erroneous principle on the basis of being a right to self defence Australia hundred points,1

so many people are calling for israel to stop fighting i'm wondering why no one is calling for hamas to surrender because in that case the war would end then and there if the palestinians really want this war to end they need to rise up against hamas and stop collaborating with hamas terrorists,0

israeli was founded in on the mythical claim that god promised them this land in the old testament back around be that's about . i years back you wake up after years to remember that your god promised you some land where you have to go and wipe out its indigenous people and bring in your own people who your god prefers grinning squinting face grinning squinting face grinning squinting face smiling face with tear how fucked up is this argument the zionists invented because genuine die good jews don't accept this myth in fact they fight it whenever possible this myth for the following reasons i convince the jews around the world to migrate to their home land that their god promised them which they call israeli or palestine to arabs i justify the taking over of palestine the real reason why the zionists worked hard on establishing home for jews in the late the and early the centuries was the rising antisemetism around the world and especially in europe the hitler's gas champers against jews which was a horrible thing no doubt in we helped them garner more support to establish their home especially from britain and the us hence their independence war in where they defeated the palestinians and arabs to take over half of palestine then they launched another surprise attack in to take over the other half the west bank and gaza so israeli is an occupation just because youlre hated and persecuted around the world doesn't give you the right to occupy another country and make its people suffer times you did if you have doubts about this narration just google “belfour declaration or “zionism”.,1
everything you see hamas is to blame and he is gonna pay the price for killing innocent civilians men women children babies i&#;m not jealous in hamas terrorists once they face idf soldiers special forces who eager to eliminate the barbaric nazis-isis-hamas regime for all the people that call yo free palestine did you condemn hamas atrocities first you prefer to support dark cruel regime over israel which is a beacon to the free world,0

"i am ashamed of my country the usa for the critical support of israeli we are being told israel is morally superior to hamas but it&#;s not true hamas just gave israel a small dose of what israel did to the palestinians in - when the zionists staged massacres and atrocities to ethnically cleanse the palestinians from their homes the zionist plan to do this was in place even before the holocaust starting in the so israel sent spies to every palestinian town and village to gather information about how each could best be attacked when the order was finally given in , the israeli troops went into each village/town. they herded everyone into the town square then lined up all of the leaders of the arab community and shot them in the head the people were then told to leave and never return anyone who resisted was killed some i palestinians were driven from their homes in this way massacres were also staged to scare the people into leaving many of the palestinians who fled ended up in refugee camps in gaza set up by the un the gaza residents of today are the descendants of those refugees they lost everything family members homes property and their future this is the ugly reality that americans fail to understand because the zionist owned media repeats endless lies sadly most americans believe whatever they are told wake up people the neurons jewish warmongers like victoria land and anthony blinked at the us state department already had us on the brink of nuclear war with russia over ukraine now i because of israel&#;s racist apartheid system i we face another crisis that can just as easily escalate to we ii i in an afternoon. americans please realize we are in danger of losing our country zionists rule american they own congress wall street most of the us war machine the media and hollywood if the american people do not wake up soon our + year experiment in democratic government is over",1
