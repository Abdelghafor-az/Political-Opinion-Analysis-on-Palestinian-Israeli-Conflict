@IslamIsTheSolution98,"To Israel - The Doors of Repentance are open. Don’t leave it until it’s too late!

“And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.” Quran 2:163

“Say: My servants who have wronged yourselves, never despair of God’s mercy. God forgives all sins: He is truly the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” [Qur’an, 39.53]

“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: ‘If a person accepts Islam, such that his Islam is good, Allah will decree reward for every good deed that he did before, and every bad deed that he did before will be erased. Then after that will come the reckoning; each good deed will be rewarded ten times up to seven hundred times. And each bad deed will be recorded as it is, unless Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, forgives it.'” [Sunan an-Nasa’i]

Indeed disbelief is an evil thing. It does not show the right way. The definitions of  truth, logic and justice are warped and different for every person. There is no fear of reprisal or punishment of hellfire. There is a false sense of security due to misbelief in redemption. Somehow or another, no matter how nice a disbelieving person is, they will do injustice to others - sometimes not even realising they are doing it. Even the nicest people can turn ugly and harm people after drinking alcohol, for example. Allah, out of His mercy on us, hates that we harm each other. Only if we sincerely follow His commands and the teachings of His Prophet (peace be to him) such evils can be avoided. This applies to Muslims too of course. But disbelief also means denying the rights of the Creator, and believing about Him what He told us, His Books and His Messengers, and distinguishing between them, rejecting sone while accepting others. How wretched that a soul denies the One who created it and rejects what He revealed as if he/she know better!?

God’s Warning to Those who Disbelieve 

Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means): {...And your Lord does injustice to no one.} [Quran 18:49] Moreover, the Qudsi hadeeth reads, ""Oh! My servants, I have made injustice unlawful for Me and unlawful for you, so do not commit injustice against one another."" [Muslim]

 ""…Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place."" [Quran 18: 29]

""On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said, 'Taste [the result of] what you used to do.'"" [Quran 29: 55]

 ""Indeed, the criminals are in error and madness. The Day they are dragged into the Fire on their faces [it will be said], 'Taste the touch of Saqar (i.e., Hell).'"" [Quran 54: 47-48]

{[He] Who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving.} [Quran 67:2]

And it is He Who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.} [Quran 23:78] 

{But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.} [Ta-Ha 20:82]

There’s still time. Don’t leave it until it’s too late!

The Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said that Allaah The Almighty accepts repentance at all times, except when the soul reaches the throat at the time of death. [Ahmad and others, Al-Arnaa’oot and Al-Albaani declared this Hadeeth as (Hasan)]

They combine terrorists and civilians into a single number, and the number of deaths is likewise exaggerated. 

Take all that together and you begin to understand why the numbers are jumping from day to day, from 10,000 to 12,000 to 15,000 to 18,000 to 20,000. Basically, add up the number of people who typically die in Gaza on an typical Tuesday + the extra people who have died due to general military conditions on the ground + people who are killed by Hamas + terrorists who are killed by Israel, and you can approach the numbers that the Hamas ‘Health Ministry’ puts out.",0,0,BBC News,England,1

“And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?”
Gospel of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 3.

“And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.”
Gospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 8 to 11.

“All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.”
Gospel of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 8 to 10.

“And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”
Gospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 25 to 28.

“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”
Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16 to 18.

“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.”
First Corinthians, chapter 15, verse 3 to 6.

Acts, chapter 8, verse 22.

Second Peter, chapter 3, verse 8.

“knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”
Second Peter, chapter 3, verse 3 to 4.

“For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”
First Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 3.

“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
First Thessalonians, chapter 4, verse 16 to 17.

“in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”

To start the process, the IDF dropped over 26,000 tonnes of explosives on Gaza, the equivalent of two nuclear bombs, on the already beleaguered civilians of Gaza! this has caused over 14,000 deaths, another 8,000 still lie buried under tons of fallen rubble! in the last 30 days over 1.4 million Palestinians have already been displaced, they have to live in tents, with the onset of winter, thousands

more will die! yet the IDF say that bombing will resume in Gaza, after the temporary ceasefire! Netanyahu, is not far removed from Hitler and his ethnic cleansing during WW2. When will the leaders of the world stop this needless slaughter?",0,0,NBC News,USA,1

@Soldat_Special_Doofy,"Petits rappels pour les amnésiques, avec leur morale à sens unique. 
La Charte du Hamas, dont personne ne parle, prévoit toujours de rayer Israël de la carte et d’exterminer le peuple juif. 
Ce que la planète entière semble avoir oublié. Difficile de négocier sur de telles bases !
En 1947, ce sont les Arabes qui ont refusé le partage de la Palestine en deux États, car ils refusaient la présence d’un État juif à leurs côtés. 
Les Juifs ont accepté et ont fait d’un désert un pays moderne.
Les Arabes ont toujours été les agresseurs lors des trois guerre de 1948, 1967 et 1973.
Il y a 2 millions d’Arabes israéliens en Israël, soit 22 % de la population, qui ont les mêmes droits que les Juifs. Mais il y a encore 16 États arabes qui refusent aux Juifs tout accès à leur territoire. Qui est intolérant ?
Rappelons qu’Israël a évacué Gaza en 2005. Qu’a fait aussitôt le Hamas ? Il a fait la guerre au Fatah pour prendre le pouvoir. En jetant les chef du Fatah du haut des toits, il a pris le contrôle du territoire en 2007 et chassé le Fatah en Cisjordanie. Depuis, ce sont des dizaines de milliers de roquettes qui se sont abattues sur Israël. Qui est l’agresseur ?
S’il y a tant de victimes à Gaza, c’est parce que ces malheureux civils sont utilisés comme boucliers humains par le mouvement terroriste. Que le Hamas désarme et libère les otages et les bombardements cesseront. C’est le Hamas qui met sa population en danger.",0,0,NBC News,USA,0

With machine guns mounted on the back of jeeps they strafed the countryside. Those that did not flee were subjected to terror and degradation.

Citizens of nations that abetted this senseless, evil act will, in turn, be victimized and die homeless.

¹      No pity. No remorse. Devoid of conscience. Genocidal. Racist. An action for a doubtful cause served to conceal their true motive, their atrocities shielded from criticism by a campaign bereft of merit. An invocation by occupiers caught up in this conflagration is never to God, it is always to the Cremation Cult that pardons their presence on land that does not belong to them, having long ago discarded the pretense that their brazen theft of real estate was the outcome of a divinely ordained pledge.
   
²     The plan contrived by the British, approved by the UN, requiring Palestinians to relocate from their homes where their livelihoods had been established over countless generations was tantamount to a slow death sentence. Their means of earning a living was terminated and even if they had funds to make relocation possible, which most did not, they would have encountered resentment, overt hostility and violence in an effort to drive them back and would not have been able to recover from their ruin.

@GoalWalker," @stephandevere2812  Why? Palestinians, Christians, and Jews have shared the region. Why kick out one over the other? Isn't that just as bad as removing Jews from countries?

To yours, no. Egypt has had problems with Hamas and other insurgencies in their own region. If they were to attack Israel from the Sinai Peninsula, then that would give Israel an excuse to attack Egypt. Egypt's President El Sisi has been very clear and firm on this. The infrastructure of the Sinai Peninsula is already strained with the approx. 600,000 people and their own infrastructure strained.

Also, Jordan is already having one of the largest number of refugees per capita worldwide. Adding more than two million more would severely cripple their own strained infrastructure.

The better question is: Why doesn't Israel allow Palestinians into their territory to become citizens and vote? Why not allow them to be indoctrinated into their society? Why pass off the Palestinians to other countries than to embrace them as apart of the two-state solution?",0,0,NBC News,USA,0

@mrmelmba,"In 1948, a well-funded gang pursuing power—that did not lack shelter—drove inhabitants out of their homes and seized their property, having come from fine homes themselves that local residents could only dream of owning. With machine guns mounted on the back of jeeps they strafed the countryside. Those that did not flee were subjected to terror and degradation.

Citizens of nations that abetted this senseless, evil act will, in turn, be victimized and die homeless.

That is already happening.
   

¹      No pity. No remorse. Devoid of conscience. Genocidal. Racist. An action for a doubtful cause served to conceal their true motive, their atrocities shielded from criticism by a campaign bereft of merit. An invocation by occupiers caught up in this conflagration is never to God, it is always to the Cremation Cult that pardons their presence on land that does not belong to them, having long ago discarded the pretense that their brazen theft of real estate was the outcome of a divinely ordained pledge.
   
²     The plan contrived by the British, approved by the UN, requiring Palestinians to relocate from their homes where their livelihoods had been established over countless generations was tantamount to a slow death sentence. Their means of earning a living was terminated and even if they had funds to make relocation possible, which most did not, they would have encountered resentment, overt hostility and violence in an effort to drive them back and would not have been able to recover from their ruin.

²³     Now go and smite...spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling.  — I Samuel ch. 15, v. 3.

Germany staged a false-flag event in 1939, saying that Poland attacked Germany first.  Israel needs ""Lebensraum"" in Gaza.  Hamas attacked a music festival (low strategic target) using paragliders (kites with motors).  Over 10,000 Palestinians have been killed, and many are children. Israel now wants to send all Palestinians to the U.S., and is sending its Black migrants to Europe.

@destinybaron5115," @nickelbutt   there are no “ settlement “ in Gaza . Are you talking about Jews living in sovereign Israel across the border ??  That’s like saying Canadians can’t live in canAda by the Canadian border . And no there had been many who died because Hammas savages went door to door killing everyone .  Do you condemn Hammas massacre or are you a hammas supporter??

Israel building Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria does NOT violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Article 49 of the Geneva Convention was created in order to prevent a repeat of what happened in Europe under the malaise aggression of Nazism. For this reason, Article 49 of the Geneva Convention states, “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.”  Article 2 of the Geneva Convention has made clear that the Fourth Geneva Convention only applies to two or more high contracting parties, which is not the case at . Jordan’s annexation of Judea and Samaria  Egypt occupation of Gaza was a violation of international law . According to the San Remo Resolution of April 25, 1920 and the Mandate for Palestine of July 24, 1922, Judea and Samaria, East Jerusalem, and Gaza were all supposed to be part of a Jewish state. These agreements are still relevant, since Article 80 of the UN Charter states that all mandates of the League of Nations are still valid.

Can you show one example where a country is said to violate the Geneva convention for  building communities in its sovereign land previously occupied by a hostile enemy ?

Give me one .",0,0,NBC News,USA,1
@nickelbutt," @destinybaron5115  There are Israeli settlements directly outside of the Gaza Strip. Thats why the 10/7 terror attacks were so destructive: if there was a DMZ, the civilian casualties would have been far less.

When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, know that its destruction is near.

Then those who are in Judea will flee to the mountains, and those who are within the city will go out, and those who are in the countryside will not enter there.

These are the days of punishment to fulfill all that is written.

Woe to those with child and to those giving suckling in those days, for there will be great tribulation on the earth and wrath for this people.

They will fall by the edge of the sword and be carried away into captivity to all nations, and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and on the earth the peoples will be troubled and confused because of the roar of the sea and the waves.

People will faint from fear at what is coming on the world, because the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

But when these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.""

For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, so the Son gives life to whom he wills.
For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son.""

Hebrews 9:27-28
It is appointed for man to die once, and after this the judgment.

You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. ’

But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.

So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unjust.

If you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?

And if you salute only your brethren, what do you do more than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same

Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" Matthew 5:43-48.

Those who believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the Spirit of Almighty GOD, and follow His will, will sit with Him on His throne.

@paulpeter-po5rd," @TmanRock9  Your full of b.s hasbara shill.  Tell us about the Belfour Declaration? tell us about the last 75+ years of zionist jews ethnically cleansing the Palestinians from their lands?  Tell us about the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians before hamas was created?
Are you serious? God expelled the jews from Palestine because of their evil and wickedness and were told in their Torah not to return, and yet, here we see the jews disobeying God yet again and returning to Palestine and resuming their evil and wickedness.  The evil occupiers are from the synagogue of satan,  and most of them are atheist.  God will destroy them not bless them.  Even the Real Jews despise them just like the rest of the world, the Real Jews refuse to go to Palestine and protest along side Palestinian supporters.

@KING_OF_KINGS_ANDLORD_OF_LORDS,"There is no book of mine, only the Words of Almighty GOD and the Words of His only begotten son, the LORD Yeshua, who paid for the sins of the world and us humans.

Read Jeremiah 7 and Matthew 23.
However, what we must not forget is that we must receive all of GOD's Words and will in the Old Testament 39 and the New Testament 27 through the Holy Spirit.

May the LORD bless you❤️
