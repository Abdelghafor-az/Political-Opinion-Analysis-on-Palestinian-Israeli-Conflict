@IslamIsTheSolution98,"To Israel - The Doors of Repentance are open. Don’t leave it until it’s too late!

“And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.” Quran 2:163

“Say: My servants who have wronged yourselves, never despair of God’s mercy. God forgives all sins: He is truly the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” [Qur’an, 39.53]

“The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: ‘If a person accepts Islam, such that his Islam is good, Allah will decree reward for every good deed that he did before, and every bad deed that he did before will be erased. Then after that will come the reckoning; each good deed will be rewarded ten times up to seven hundred times. And each bad deed will be recorded as it is, unless Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, forgives it.'” [Sunan an-Nasa’i]

Indeed disbelief is an evil thing. It does not show the right way. The definitions of  truth, logic and justice are warped and different for every person. There is no fear of reprisal or punishment of hellfire. There is a false sense of security due to misbelief in redemption. Somehow or another, no matter how nice a disbelieving person is, they will do injustice to others - sometimes not even realising they are doing it. Even the nicest people can turn ugly and harm people after drinking alcohol, for example. Allah, out of His mercy on us, hates that we harm each other. Only if we sincerely follow His commands and the teachings of His Prophet (peace be to him) such evils can be avoided. This applies to Muslims too of course. But disbelief also means denying the rights of the Creator, and believing about Him what He told us, His Books and His Messengers, and distinguishing between them, rejecting sone while accepting others. How wretched that a soul denies the One who created it and rejects what He revealed as if he/she know better!?

God’s Warning to Those who Disbelieve 

Allaah, The Exalted, says (what means): {...And your Lord does injustice to no one.} [Quran 18:49] Moreover, the Qudsi hadeeth reads, ""Oh! My servants, I have made injustice unlawful for Me and unlawful for you, so do not commit injustice against one another."" [Muslim]

 ""…Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place."" [Quran 18: 29]

""On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said, 'Taste [the result of] what you used to do.'"" [Quran 29: 55]

 ""Indeed, the criminals are in error and madness. The Day they are dragged into the Fire on their faces [it will be said], 'Taste the touch of Saqar (i.e., Hell).'"" [Quran 54: 47-48]

{[He] Who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving.} [Quran 67:2]

And it is He Who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.} [Quran 23:78] 

{But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.} [Ta-Ha 20:82]

There’s still time. Don’t leave it until it’s too late!

The Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said that Allaah The Almighty accepts repentance at all times, except when the soul reaches the throat at the time of death. [Ahmad and others, Al-Arnaa’oot and Al-Albaani declared this Hadeeth as (Hasan)]

The Hamas-run 'Health Ministry' counts in their casualty counts Gazan civilians killed by Hamas, by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, by friendly fire, by stray fire, by death from illness and dehydration, by death from Israeli fire. They combine terrorists and civilians into a single number, and the number of deaths is likewise exaggerated. 

Take all that together and you begin to understand why the numbers are jumping from day to day, from 10,000 to 12,000 to 15,000 to 18,000 to 20,000. Basically, add up the number of people who typically die in Gaza on an typical Tuesday + the extra people who have died due to general military conditions on the ground + people who are killed by Hamas + terrorists who are killed by Israel, and you can approach the numbers that the Hamas ‘Health Ministry’ puts out.",0,0,BBC News,England

“And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?”
Gospel of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 3.

“And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.”
Gospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 8 to 11.

“All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.”
Gospel of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 8 to 10.

“And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”
Gospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 25 to 28.

“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”
Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16 to 18.

“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.”
First Corinthians, chapter 15, verse 3 to 6.

“Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.”
Acts, chapter 8, verse 22.

“Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

Second Peter, chapter 3, verse 8.

“knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”
Second Peter, chapter 3, verse 3 to 4.

“For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”
First Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 3.

“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
First Thessalonians, chapter 4, verse 16 to 17.

“in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”

Jesus will not return again, and those who captured him and handed him over to the Romans take over the land and have power and authority.
The United States has been hijacked by a cabal that owns and controls the money, the media, and a powerful extremist lobby that supports the State of Israel.
Hundreds of billions have been spent on this parasitic racist state, which should have been spent on tens of thousands of homeless people, drug victims, veterans, and those who cannot pay their loans.
All the peoples and countries of the world view the U.S as a hypocrite who raises false slogans because of his condoning the crimes of the rogue state of Israel.
The U.S veto was lifted more than forty times against resolutions issued by the UN Council criticizing Israel!
What is strange is that Israel is spying on America, and this has been revealed twice!! No American official, artist, journalist, or company owner will be able to criticize Israel!
Journalists, children and women are being targeted and killed, hospitals, mosques and churches are being bombed, bombed and demolished, water and electricity are being cut off, sieges, lies, fabrication and deception are taking place... and all of these are practices that this despicable state has been practicing on the indigenous people for more than 75 years.
All international bodies and human rights organizations have issued statements and reports documenting these practices.
He is an ugly, racist child who was born illegitimately. The UK placed him in the Middle East, through the ill-fated ""Balfour Declaration"", where he shares no language, religion or culture, and bears no resemblance to the indigenous people or the countries around him.
Now U.S is defending him and spending on him hysterically and insanely, until he has become a monster that most of the world hates..
