@darinanetopilova5148,What's the point of sending aid in when allowing Israel to monitor its convoy into Palestine. Israel will  no doubt do all they can to reduce the amount coming in as mass murdering through violence  direct atttacks and starvation of Palestinians is the ultimate goal of theirs. They blocked the aid coming in at every chance they had...They only allowed 20 trucks in to feed over 2 million!!! people after the first month of their relentless brutality and destruction. This is an utter disgrace..and yet again Israel is being given another pass,0,0,BBC News,England

I guess the UK had the decency to be embarassed about not supporting a ceasfire in Gaza... not so the US...

When world opinion supports Palestine... and Kier Starmer has the audacity to say, in Parliament, that the UK is united in support for Israel???

There's being out of touch... and then there's political corruption gone too far...

Now Biden has to meet with US Zionist 'mega donors' to tell them: They're not buying the propaganda anymore guys...

It's war crimes, and genocide...
