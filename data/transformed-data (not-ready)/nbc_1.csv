@gkep7,"I believe that Netanyahu allowed Hamas to attack Israel on 7th October, he knew that Israeli lives and hostages would be taken! a small sacrifice in the scheme of things, but he needed a good excuse to declare war on the Palestinians, to gain more land for Israel, and begin the process of genocide to reduce the Palestinian population! the only way for him to create the Zionist dream of a one party state! By depriving the Palestinians of their homes, water, food, hospitals, electricity & fuel, etc, they would be forced to flee the country. To start the process, the IDF dropped over 26,000 tonnes of explosives on Gaza, the equivalent of two nuclear bombs, on the already beleaguered civilians of Gaza! this has caused over 14,000 deaths, another 8,000 still lie buried under tons of fallen rubble! in the last 30 days over 1.4 million Palestinians have already been displaced, they have to live in tents, with the onset of winter, thousands

more will die! yet the IDF say that bombing will resume in Gaza, after the temporary ceasefire! Netanyahu, is not far removed from Hitler and his ethnic cleansing during WW2. When will the leaders of the world stop this needless slaughter?",0,0,NBC News,USA

@Soldat_Special_Doofy,"Petits rappels pour les amnésiques, avec leur morale à sens unique. 
La Charte du Hamas, dont personne ne parle, prévoit toujours de rayer Israël de la carte et d’exterminer le peuple juif. 
Ce que la planète entière semble avoir oublié. Difficile de négocier sur de telles bases !
En 1947, ce sont les Arabes qui ont refusé le partage de la Palestine en deux États, car ils refusaient la présence d’un État juif à leurs côtés. 
Les Juifs ont accepté et ont fait d’un désert un pays moderne.
Les Arabes ont toujours été les agresseurs lors des trois guerre de 1948, 1967 et 1973.
Il y a 2 millions d’Arabes israéliens en Israël, soit 22 % de la population, qui ont les mêmes droits que les Juifs. Mais il y a encore 16 États arabes qui refusent aux Juifs tout accès à leur territoire. Qui est intolérant ?
Rappelons qu’Israël a évacué Gaza en 2005. Qu’a fait aussitôt le Hamas ? Il a fait la guerre au Fatah pour prendre le pouvoir. En jetant les chef du Fatah du haut des toits, il a pris le contrôle du territoire en 2007 et chassé le Fatah en Cisjordanie. Depuis, ce sont des dizaines de milliers de roquettes qui se sont abattues sur Israël. Qui est l’agresseur ?
S’il y a tant de victimes à Gaza, c’est parce que ces malheureux civils sont utilisés comme boucliers humains par le mouvement terroriste. Que le Hamas désarme et libère les otages et les bombardements cesseront. C’est le Hamas qui met sa population en danger.",0,0,NBC News,USA
