@GoalWalker," @stephandevere2812  Why? Palestinians, Christians, and Jews have shared the region. Why kick out one over the other? Isn't that just as bad as removing Jews from countries?

To yours, no. Egypt has had problems with Hamas and other insurgencies in their own region. If they were to attack Israel from the Sinai Peninsula, then that would give Israel an excuse to attack Egypt. Egypt's President El Sisi has been very clear and firm on this. The infrastructure of the Sinai Peninsula is already strained with the approx. 600,000 people and their own infrastructure strained.

Also, Jordan is already having one of the largest number of refugees per capita worldwide. Adding more than two million more would severely cripple their own strained infrastructure.

The better question is: Why doesn't Israel allow Palestinians into their territory to become citizens and vote? Why not allow them to be indoctrinated into their society? Why pass off the Palestinians to other countries than to embrace them as apart of the two-state solution?",0,0,NBC News,USA
