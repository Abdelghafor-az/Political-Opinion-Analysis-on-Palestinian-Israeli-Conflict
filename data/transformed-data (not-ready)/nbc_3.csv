@Truthteller93,"This conflict in Gaza has similarities with stories in many religious epics. There is a poor and tormented population of Gaza. There is a most powerful ruler (Biden) who is killing children of these poor people through his vassal (Netanyahu). This type of scenario is described in Old Testament, New Testament, Quran (Pharaoh-Moses story) and so many others. On top of that this massacre is being done in the land of prophets, where Jesus Christ was crucified under conspiracy by Romans (the world power of the time). The parallels should bother every one.",1,0,NBC News,USA

@33Donner77,"Look up the 1948 ""Nakba"".  Today, Israel needs its ""Lebensraum"" (living space), just like Germany did in 1939.  Germany staged a false-flag event in 1939, saying that Poland attacked Germany first.  Israel needs ""Lebensraum"" in Gaza.  Hamas attacked a music festival (low strategic target) using paragliders (kites with motors).  Over 10,000 Palestinians have been killed, and many are children. Israel now wants to send all Palestinians to the U.S., and is sending its Black migrants to Europe. Was this a false-flag event, allowing motor kites to fly over the most defended border in the world? Yellen says the U.S. can fight two wars, one in Ukraine (Pale of Settlement), and one in Israel. Blinken agrees.  Oy vey.  
In the 1930s, Germany considered sending them to Madagascar, an island with no adjacent enemies.  Instead, after WW II, the globalist powers obtained the UN charter for Israel, right in the middle of the Islamic world.

@destinybaron5115," @nickelbutt   there are no “ settlement “ in Gaza . Are you talking about Jews living in sovereign Israel across the border ??  That’s like saying Canadians can’t live in canAda by the Canadian border . And no there had been many who died because Hammas savages went door to door killing everyone .  Do you condemn Hammas massacre or are you a hammas supporter??

Israel building Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria does NOT violate the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Article 49 of the Geneva Convention was created in order to prevent a repeat of what happened in Europe under the malaise aggression of Nazism. For this reason, Article 49 of the Geneva Convention states, “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.”  Article 2 of the Geneva Convention has made clear that the Fourth Geneva Convention only applies to two or more high contracting parties, which is not the case at . Jordan’s annexation of Judea and Samaria  Egypt occupation of Gaza was a violation of international law . According to the San Remo Resolution of April 25, 1920 and the Mandate for Palestine of July 24, 1922, Judea and Samaria, East Jerusalem, and Gaza were all supposed to be part of a Jewish state. These agreements are still relevant, since Article 80 of the UN Charter states that all mandates of the League of Nations are still valid.

Can you show one example where a country is said to violate the Geneva convention for  building communities in its sovereign land previously occupied by a hostile enemy ?

Give me one .",0,0,NBC News,USA
